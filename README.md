# Pedotransfer functions to predict soil water retention for treated wastewater irrigated soil

Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were used to predict soil water retention for treated wastewater (TWW) irrigated soil. Three main parts were included:

1. Evaluation of the existing PTFs.
2. Development of new PTFs taking consideration of TWW effect.
3. Evaluation and development of SAR-PTFs, further combined with the new PTFs from step 2.
