# Pedotransfer Functions to Predict Soil Water Retention for Treated Wastewater Irrigated Soil

This repository contains pedotransfer functions (PTFs) used to predict soil water retention for treated wastewater (TWW) irrigated soil. The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Evaluation of the existing PTFs**: Assessing how well current pedotransfer functions perform for TWW-irrigated soils.
2. **Development of new PTFs considering the effects of TWW**: Creating new PTFs that account for the influence of treated wastewater on soil properties.
3. **Evaluation and development of SAR-PTFs**: Developing new SAR (Sodium Adsorption Ratio) PTFs and integrating them with the PTFs developed in step 2.
